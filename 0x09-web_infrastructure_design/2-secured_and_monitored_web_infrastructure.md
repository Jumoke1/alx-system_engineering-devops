* What are firewalls for: 
* Firewalls are network security devices or software applications that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks (such as the internet), helping to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, malware infections, and other cyber threats. 
* Why is the traffic served over HTTPS:
*  Traffic served over HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is encrypted to provide confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data being transmitted between a web server and a client's web browser. This encryption helps protect sensitive information, such as personal data, login credentials, and financial details, from interception or tampering by malicious actors. 
* What monitoring is used for:
 Monitoring is used to observe, track, and analyze various aspects of a system, network, application, or infrastructure in real-time or over a period of time. It helps in detecting performance issues, security threats, anomalies, and trends, allowing for proactive maintenance, troubleshooting, and optimization. Monitoring also provides valuable insights for capacity planning, resource allocation, and decision-making. 
* How the monitoring tool is collecting data: 
* Monitoring tools collect data through various methods, including:
    * Agent-based monitoring: Installing lightweight software agents on monitored devices or servers to collect data locally and report it back to a central monitoring system.
    * Agentless monitoring: Utilizing protocols such as SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation), or APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to gather data from remote systems without the need for installing agents.
    * Log file analysis: Parsing and analyzing log files generated by applications, servers, or devices to extract relevant performance metrics, error messages, and other valuable information.
    * Synthetic monitoring: Simulating user interactions with applications or websites to monitor performance and availability from an end-user perspective.

* Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS:
*  If you want to monitor your web server's QPS (Queries Per Second), you can follow these steps:
    * Choose a monitoring tool that supports measuring QPS metrics.
    * Configure the monitoring tool to monitor the web server where QPS data is needed.
    * Set up appropriate monitoring checks or probes to collect QPS data from the web server.
    * Define thresholds or alerting rules to trigger notifications if QPS exceeds or falls below acceptable levels.
    * Monitor and analyze the collected QPS data regularly to identify any performance issues, trends, or anomalies.
    * Take proactive measures to optimize server performance, scale resources as needed, or troubleshoot any issues impacting QPS.


* Terminating SSL at the load balancer level:
    * While terminating SSL at the load balancer can offload SSL decryption from backend servers, it can be an issue for security and scalability reasons.
    * Single point of failure: If the load balancer fails, all SSL termination would cease, disrupting the entire application's availability.
    * Limited scalability: SSL termination at the load balancer can limit scalability since SSL decryption is a resource-intensive process. As traffic increases, the load balancer may become a bottleneck, impacting performance.
    * Reduced security: Decrypting SSL at the load balancer exposes sensitive data (such as credentials, session tokens) on internal network segments, increasing the risk of data interception or unauthorized access.
* Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes:
    * This setup poses several potential issues, primarily related to availability, reliability, and performance:
    * Single point of failure: If the MySQL server goes down, all write operations will fail, causing downtime and potentially data loss.
    * Scalability limitations: A single MySQL server may not handle high write loads efficiently, leading to performance degradation during peak periods.
    * Data consistency: Without redundancy or failover mechanisms, there's a risk of data inconsistency or loss in case of hardware failure or database corruption.
    * Limited geographic redundancy: Having a single writable MySQL server makes it challenging to implement geographically distributed redundancy or disaster recovery solutions.
* Having servers with all the same components (database, web server, and application server):
    * This setup can introduce several issues related to scalability, resource utilization, and fault isolation:
    * Resource contention: Combining multiple services on the same server can lead to resource contention, where one service monopolizes system resources, impacting the performance of others.
    * Difficulty in scaling: Scaling individual components becomes challenging since they are tightly coupled. For example, scaling the database layer may require scaling the web and application servers as well, even if they don't require additional resources.
    * Lack of fault isolation: If one component experiences issues or failures (e.g., database server crashes), it can impact the entire server, affecting all services hosted on it.
    * Reduced flexibility: Having all components on the same server reduces flexibility in deployment and maintenance. Updates or changes to one component may require downtime or affect the availability of others.
