Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: May 10, 2024, 08:00 AM UTC
End Time: May 10, 2024, 11:30 AM UTC
Impact:
The outage affected our cloud storage service, causing intermittent errors and significantly slowing down file uploads and downloads.
Users experienced delays and failures in accessing their files, resulting in frustration and productivity loss.
Approximately 75% of users were impacted by the service degradation.
Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to uneven distribution of traffic and overload on one of the storage servers.

Timeline:

08:00 AM UTC: Issue Detected
Monitoring alerts triggered due to a sudden increase in latency for file operations.
08:05 AM UTC: Investigation Initiated
On-call engineers began investigating the issue, suspecting a potential problem with the storage infrastructure.
08:20 AM UTC: Initial Assessment
Network connectivity and hardware health checks performed on the storage servers showed no abnormalities.
08:45 AM UTC: Escalation
As the root cause remained unidentified, the incident was escalated to senior engineers and system administrators.
09:00 AM UTC: Load Balancer Examination
Load balancer configurations were scrutinized, revealing an inconsistency in the traffic distribution algorithm.
09:30 AM UTC: Misleading Investigation Paths
Initially, focus remained on the storage server hardware, leading to no significant findings and a delay in identifying the root cause.
10:00 AM UTC: Load Balancer Adjustment
Load balancer settings were modified to evenly distribute traffic among all storage servers, alleviating the overload.
11:30 AM UTC: Service Restoration
With the load balancer reconfiguration, service operations returned to normal, and users regained access to their files without interruptions.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused an imbalance in traffic distribution, resulting in one storage server being overwhelmed while others remained underutilized. The issue was resolved by adjusting the load balancer settings to evenly distribute traffic across all storage servers.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Implement automated load balancer configuration validation checks to detect anomalies proactively.
Enhance monitoring systems to provide real-time insights into traffic patterns and server loads.
Establish regular training sessions for engineering teams on load balancer management and troubleshooting best practices.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations across all services and environments.
Develop runbooks for load balancer troubleshooting and recovery procedures.
Schedule periodic load testing exercises to validate load balancer performance under various scenarios.
Establish clear communication channels for incident escalation and resolution, ensuring swift response to service disruptions.
Conclusion:
The outage was a result of a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, highlighting the critical importance of meticulous configuration management and proactive monitoring. By implementing the identified corrective and preventative measures, we aim to strengthen the resilience of our infrastructure and minimize the risk of similar incidents in the future, ensuring a seamless experience for our users.
